🚀 Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded Twitter dataset (twitter_validation.csv)

Dropped irrelevant entries

Visualized class distribution

2. Preprocessing

Tokenization with NLTK TweetTokenizer

Removed special characters, numbers, and punctuation

Applied stemming with SnowballStemmer

Removed stopwords

3. Feature Engineering

Converted tweets into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer

4. Modeling (to be extended)

Prepared features X and target labels y

Next steps: train models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM

5. Evaluation (to be added)

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLTK

Scikit-learn

📌 Future Work

Add multiple ML models for classification

Compare performance across models

Experiment with deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
